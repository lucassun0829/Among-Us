# Among-Us

You will be given a graph as a collection of x-y coordinates (vertices) and a rule or rules about how they are connected (edges). This project has three parts:

Part A: Calculate a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to find the subset of edges that represent lowest edge weight cost to connect all vertices.
Part B: Research and implement an algorithm to approximate a solution to the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP); the solution need not be optimal, but it must be “close enough” and “fast enough” to satisfy the autograder.
Part C: Calculate the weight of optimal an TSP solution, using a branch and bound algorithm.
